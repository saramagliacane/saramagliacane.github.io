For teaching matters, you can contact me via [Canvas](https://canvas.uva.nl). 


**PhD students.** I have an open [PhD position](https://werkenbij.uva.nl/en/vacancies/phd-position-on-learning-concepts-with-theoretical-guarantees-using-causality-and-rl-netherlands-14071) of Learning concepts with theoretical guarantees in collaboration with Frans Oliehoek at TU Delft. Deadline: 15 June.



**Other jobs.** Currently I don't have any open vacancy for interns, research assistants or postdocs, but if I do, they will be announced on the [UvA vacancies website](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/search/?createNewAlert=false&q=&optionsFacetsDD_department=&optionsFacetsDD_shifttype=Promotieplaats&optionsFacetsDD_facility=Faculteit+der+Natuurw.%2C+Wiskunde+%26+Informatica).


**Master students.** If you are a Master in AI student at the University of Amsterdam and are interested in causality, feel free to contact me for potential thesis topics. As a rule, I also don't supervise Bachelor or Master students from other universities.
