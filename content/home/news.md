- until June 15: I have an open [PhD position](https://werkenbij.uva.nl/en/vacancies/phd-position-on-learning-concepts-with-theoretical-guarantees-using-causality-and-rl-netherlands-14071) of Learning concepts with theoretical guarantees in collaboration with Frans Oliehoek at TU Delft

- May 2025: [Matyas](https://matyasch.github.io/) went to present our work on [SNAP: Sequential Non-Ancestor Pruning](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.07857) at AISTATS 2025.

- April 2025: Organized a causality workshop with Virginia Aglietti at [DALI 2025](https://dalimeeting.org/sorrento2025/) in Sorrento.

- February 2025: My first two PhD students got their PhD, both cum laude! Congrats [Riccardo Massidda (U Pisa)] (https://bsky.app/profile/smaglia.bsky.social/post/3lifjpfg2ek2w) and [Phillip Lippe (U Amsterdam)](https://bsky.app/profile/smaglia.bsky.social/post/3lj6p4hkls224)!! Matyas and I attended the Bellairs workshop on [Causality in the Era of Foundation Models](https://bclworkshop.github.io/2025/).

- December 2024: [Guido Imbens (Stanford) visited our group](https://bsky.app/profile/amlab.bsky.social/post/3ld6cf3mbv22a).

- October 2024: Visiting Harvard to give an [invited talk on (i)CITRIS and BISCUIT](https://datascience.harvard.edu/calendar_event/causal-seminar-sara-magliacane/) in the Harvard Data Science Initiative Causal Seminar. I'm also a communication chair for [CLeaR 2025](https://www.cclear.cc/2025) and helping organize a [CRL workshop at NeurIPS 2024](https://crl-community.github.io/neurips24.html).

- September 2024: I have been travelling quite a lot, first to Dagstuhl for a seminar on [Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods Join Forces for Reliable Autonomy
](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/24361), then to Nijmegen to give a keynote at [PGM 2024](https://www.ru.nl/en/about-us/events/probabilistic-graphical-models-pgm-2024), Oslo as an examiner for the PhD defense of [Ghadi Al Hajj](https://www.visual-intelligence.no/news/successful-phd-defense-by-ghadi-al-hajj) (it was successful :), and finally to MÃ¼nich for an [Oktoberfest Causality mini-workshop](https://collab.dvb.bayern/display/TUMmathstat/Miniworkshop+on+Causal+Inference+2024) organized by TUM.  

- Summer 2024: Busy summer! First I co-organized a [Logic and AI](https://ias.uva.nl/content/events/2024/07/logic-and-ai.html) workshop at the 
Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) here in Amsterdam. Then I went to [UAI 2024](https://www.auai.org/uai2024/), where [Riccardo](https://pages.di.unipi.it/massidda/) presented our UAI 2024 paper on [learning linear abstractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00394), even without knowing neither the abstract nor the concrete causal graph. There I gave an invited talk at the [Causal Inference for Time Series workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ci4ts2024/) and then helped organize the (other?) [Causal Inference workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/causaluai-2024/home). After that I  attended ICML 2024, where [Danru](https://danrux.github.io/) and I presented our ICML 2024 paper on [CRL in partially observed settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08335), while with [Yongtuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EjzPQtMAAAAJ&hl=en) we presented our ICML 2024 paper on [Amortized Equation Discovery in Hybrid Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03818). Finally, I gave an invited talk at ONRL for their [AI Seminar Series](https://ornl.github.io/events/ai-initiative-seminar-2024/).
