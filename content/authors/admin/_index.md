I am an assistant professor in the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) at the University Amsterdam and an ELLIS Scholar in the Interactive Learning and Interventional Representations
program. During Spring 2022, I was visiting the [Simons Institute in Berkeley](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) for a semester on [Causality](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/Causality2022).

My research is at the intersection of **causality** and **machine learning**. My goal is to find how can causal
reasoning improve state-of-the-art AI, especially in terms of robustness, generalization across domains/tasks,
and safety, and imbue it with the strong theoretical guarantees typical of causality research. This Figure
summarizes the research directions I have been pursuing and how they connect to each other.

My research focuses on three directions: (i) *causal representation learning* (i.e. learning causal varaibles from high-dimensional data, e.g. sequences of images \[[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03169), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06169), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09643), [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08335)\]), (i) *causal discovery* (i.e. learning causal relations from data, e.g. focusing on a statistically and computationally efficient way \[[5](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.07857)\]), and (iii) *downstream tasks*, e.g., how can causality ideas help ML/RL adapt to new domains or nonstationarity and compositionally generalize (\[[6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02729), [7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16582), [8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09205)\]). 

Previously I was a Research Scientist at [MIT-IBM Watson AI lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) and a postdoctoral researcher at IBM Research NY, working on methods to design experiments that would allow one to learn causal relations in a [sample-efficient](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/greenewald-2019-sample/) and [intervention-efficient](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/squires-2022-active/) way. I received a PhD at VU Amsterdam on [learning causal relations jointly from different experimental settings](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/mooij-2020/), even with latent confounders and small samples. During my PhD, I interned at Google Zürich and NYC. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and Torino and at the University of Trieste.
