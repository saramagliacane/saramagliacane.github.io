I am an assistant professor in the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) at the University Amsterdam and an ELLIS Scholar in the Interactive Learning and Interventional Representations
program. During Spring 2022, I was visiting the [Simons Institute in Berkeley](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) for a semester on [Causality](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/Causality2022).

My research is at the intersection of causality and machine learning (ML). My goal is to find how can causal
reasoning improve state-of-the-art AI, especially in terms of robustness, generalization across domains/tasks,
and safety, and imbue it with the strong theoretical guarantees typical of causality research. This Figure
summarizes the research directions I have been pursuing and how they connect to each other.

My research focuses on three directions: (i) *causal representation learning* (i.e. learning causal factors from high-dimensional data, e.g. sequences of images \[[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03169), [2](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/lippe2023-causal/), [3](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/lippe2023-biscuit/)\]), (i) *causal discovery* (i.e. learning causal relations from data in a statistically and computationally efficient way [4](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.07857)), and (iii) *downstream tasks*, e.g., *causality-inspired ML*, e.g. how can ideas from causality help ML/RL [adapt to new domains](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/huang-2022-adarl/), [nonstationarity](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/feng-2022-factored/) and [varying number of objects with different latent parameters](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/feng2023/), even when we cannot guarantee that we identified the true causal factors. 

Previously I was a Research Scientist at [MIT-IBM Watson AI lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) and a postdoctoral researcher at IBM Research NY, working on methods to design experiments that would allow one to learn causal relations in a [sample-efficient](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/greenewald-2019-sample/) and [intervention-efficient](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/squires-2022-active/) way. I received a PhD at VU Amsterdam on [learning causal relations jointly from different experimental settings](https://saramagliacane.github.io/publication/mooij-2020/), even with latent confounders and small samples. During my PhD, I interned at Google Zürich and NYC. Previously, I studied Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano and Torino and at the University of Trieste.
