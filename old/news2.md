- Summer 2024: Busy summer! First I will be co-organizing a ``Logic and AI'' workshop at the 
Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) here in Amsterdam. Then I will go to [UAI 2024](https://www.auai.org/uai2024/), where [Riccardo](https://pages.di.unipi.it/massidda/) will be presenting our UAI 2024 paper on [learning linear abstractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00394), even without knowing neither the abstract nor the concrete causal graph. There I will give an invited talk at the [Causal Inference for Time Series workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ci4ts2024/) and then help organize the (other?) [Causal Inference workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/causaluai-2024/home). After that I will attend ICML 2024, where [Danru](https://danrux.github.io/) and I will present our ICML 2024 paper on [CRL in partially observed settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08335), while with [Yongtuo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EjzPQtMAAAAJ&hl=en) we will present our ICML 2024 paper on [Amortized Equation Discovery in Hybrid Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03818).
